<p class="about">Burly Herd is an alternative pop band from London. Starting out as a school indie band exclusively covering The Strokes, Jack, James, Josh and Kester began writing music together and recorded their debut EP South Sea in a shed in 2015.</p>
<p class="about">Following a semi-hiatus whilst at different universities, the guys spent time experimenting with different sounds, releasing a series of songs over two years and dipping into genres from dream pop to psychedelic funk. During this period the band was approached by producer Ian Flynn, and released Jump at the beginning of 2020. </p>
<p class="about">Burly Herd have defined and refined their sound - settling securely into a Japanese disco-inspired electropop groove. Imagine a collab between Kevin Parker, Mac DeMarco and Nile Rodgers. Basslines never sit still for long, guitars switch from delicate to raw in seconds, and synths soar across the sky. Burly Herd have spent the past few years establishing themselves on the London live scene, featuring regularly at venues such as the Old Blue Last, Paper Dress Vintage and the Islington.</p>
